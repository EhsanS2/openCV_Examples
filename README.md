# OpenCV_Examples
Some basic examples that show how openCV works

## Getting started
To run these examples you need to install python on your machine.

Then you will need following libraries: 
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - An open source computer vision and machine learning software library
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Python 2D plotting library

### Installing
Installing libraries is quite straightforward using pip. Just run following commands in command line.

**Note:** after installing python on your machine, pip will install too.

Installing opencv and numpy:
```
pip install opencv-python
```

Installing matplotlib
```
pip install matplotlib
```
